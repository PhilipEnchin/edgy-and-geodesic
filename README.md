# Geodesic Spherifier

A library and CLI <!-- TODO: "and web app", and replace the prior "and" with a comma   --> for assisting in the construction of a modular origami geodesic polyhedron.

## TL;DR

I made this to help construct a modular origami geodesic sphere. There's a library and CLI <!-- "and web app", and replace the prior "and" with a comma -->. Run the CLI with `./geodesic` and see below for more details

<!-- Photo examples of icosahedron, geodesic sphere, and maybe a subdivided, but not spherified version -->

## About this project

### What is a geodesic polyhedron?

This repository constructs a [geodesic polyhedron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geodesic_polyhedron) by starting with an [icosahedron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icosahedron), subdividing the triangular faces into smaller triangles, then projecting the vertices such that they all lie on the surface of a sphere.

### Why all this for an origami project?

My original goal was to figure out how to make a modular origami geodesic polyhedron. Working out some of the math on paper led to working on a small program, which turned into this nifty little project.

## Technical considerations

### The library

### The CLI
<!-- Requirements (node, docker) -->
<!--  -->

<!-- ### The web app -->

### Testing
<!-- Requirements (node & nvm *or* VSCode dev-container extension...) -->
